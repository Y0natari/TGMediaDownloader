# TGMediaDownloader
A simple Telegram bot, which allows you to download all medias from the specific chat or channel, even if admins have turned off the opportunity to copy or download the data from the it.

# Usage
I hope, there is no sense to learn you how to install Python :)
To install requirements - open the cmd from the project folder and insert this command: 
> **pip install -r requirements.txt**


Now you can configure the bot.
Firstly, open the script and find "api_id" and "api_hash"
In these fields paste the values from your app, which you've created in
> https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps

Then, find "chat_id" and replace the value with your 13-digital ID of the needed channel or chat. Example of the ID: 
*-1000192837465*

**Have fun.**
